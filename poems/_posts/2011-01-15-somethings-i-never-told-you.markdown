title: Somethings I've Never Told You

I've told you my secrets

I've told you my lies

But there are something I've never told you

----

At times I am mad at you,

wanting to slap you...

or just push you aside

but then I see your face

and I'm all lost

Gone is the anger, gone is the pain

It's just you and me insane...

----

Something I've never told you

At times you say things

that make me cry

but then I see innocent you

the poor, little & cute you

and I give in to the joy, you bring to me

and the tears never get to fall

----

Something I've never told you

When you shout you don't love me

when you shout you don't care

Your shout tells me you do

and that is what is keeping me alive

----

Something I've never told you

You are so close to me

that I never miss you

you are a part of me

mine forever more

So go where you want to go, be what you want to be

I give you freedom with me

----

Something I've never told you

You've forgotten the promise you made

to me before we were even born

but you still keep it so well

you promised to give me reasons to be happy

and so you do, 

I need to be happy to enjoy you

and so I do

----

Something I've never told you

You come in my dreams every night

with tender kisses and endless hugs

I hug you and drift to sleep

I wake up with you in my arms

My day starts and end with you

and most of the day, I am thinking about you

----

Something I've never told you

You may think it's a lie

But I see so much love in your eyes

I love it when you fight

I love it when you are irritated

I love it when you shout in rage aloud

I love every bit of you

And so do you

I know you will see it soon

Thus I never told you

----

Something I've never told you

I gave you my life

I did everything I could do

I could give you more

but I give up and let you go

Why? Because that's how I like you

Flying and soring high

Free and in my dreams

Free you like duin [river]

And yet you are mine

----

These are some of many

things I've never told you

I know you will know it all

one day, some day

Like I do, Like your heart does.
