title: The 3 Seedlings
---
Three Seedlings found life

First fell in water
No soil, no air, no sun
Water gave it life 
And killed it as well

Second fell in farm
Fertlie Soil, Measured Water
Free Air & Full Sun
Breeded to Yield
Yielded and Died

Third fell in a jungle
Grew in wilderness
Changing water, air and sun
In it's own true expression
Lived and died wild
Had the time of his life.
